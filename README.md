## **Project status**

**Situation analysis and introductory remarks.**	

A data set shall be interpreted as a collection of statistical data which is usually included in a tabulated form. It is important to mention that most often, the columns correspond to the observed statistical characteristics and each row describes one observation from the sample. The matrix cell values describe the implementation of variable data in subsequent observations.
The Iris flower data set has been available from 1936. It was made by Ronald Fisher, the British genetic and statistician.
The purpose of this project is to research the data set and write documentation and code (in Python programming language) to investigate it. 

	
**Interpretation of results.**	
The data set includes 150 instances describing iris flowers. 
The flowers are defined by means of 4 numeric attributes (in cm) describing the:
•	length sepal,
•	width sepal, 
•	length petal,
•	width petal;  
The last qualitative attribute defines the species of the described iris (3 species):
•	setosa,
•	versicolor,
•	virginica; 
 One of the problems that can be solved with this learning set is to determine the species for the new iris flower depending on the size of its petals. This is an example of a classification task.

The table below presents detailed description of the set:
Data Set Characteristics:  	Multivariate	
Number of Instances:	150	
Area:	Life
Attribute Characteristics:	Real	
Number of Attributes:	4	
Date Donated	1988-07-01
Associated Tasks:	Classification	Missing Values	No	
Number of Web Hits:	3248084

The python code can be found in repository: analysis.py . It:
•	outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
•	saves a histogram of each variable to png files, 
•	outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
