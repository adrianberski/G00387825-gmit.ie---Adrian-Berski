    "A data set shall be interpreted as a collection of statistical data which is usually included in a tabulated form. It is important to mention that most often, the columns correspond to the observed statistical characteristics and each row describes one observation from the sample. The matrix cell values describe the implementation of variable data in subsequent observations.\n",

    "The purpose of this project is to research the data set and write documentation and code (in Python programming language) to investigate it. It`s important to mention that Data scientist can be interpreted as a process of experimentation and exploration to find answers. Therefore, data science pursues the various scientific method. The data science process includes steps particular to working with large, digital datasets. Before the real-world phenomenon was choose, every scientist needs to follow crucial steps:\n",
