    "A data set shall be interpreted as a collection of statistical data which is usually included in a tabulated form. It is important to mention that most often, the columns correspond to the observed statistical characteristics and each row describes one observation from the sample. The matrix cell values describe the implementation of variable data in subsequent observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to research the data set and write documentation and code (in Python programming language) to investigate it. It`s important to mention that Data scientist can be interpreted as a process of experimentation and exploration to find answers. Therefore, data science pursues the various scientific method. The data science process includes steps particular to working with large, digital datasets. Before the real-world phenomenon was choose, every scientist needs to follow crucial steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the necessary data;\n",
    "- Get the data;\n",
    "- Clean and organize the data;\n",
    "- Explore the data;\n",
    "- Model the data;\n",
    "- Communicate findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every of each modeling and synthesise have to include the above steps of analysis. In this project three aspects are taken into account: data scope, variable relationships and data context. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Determine the necessary data.\n",
    "In thisstate of affairs, it has been used the United States Cities Database (uscities.csv). This is up-to-date (November 18th 2020) database of United States cities and towns. \n",
    "The second set is the user_data.csv which includes information about my users, such as: education, age and location. As an example of a hypothesis which proofs that my data are neccesary to collect is a question: is there a correlation between a user’s location (rural or urban) and their age? Based on provided data, it can be defined what is rural and urban location as data sets don`t detrmine that information. \n",
    "Determination process helps to apporve or dispartove particular hypotesis and helps to define how much data are needed to collect. To do this, Sample size calculators (available online) are the best tools. They shows: Margin of error, Confidence level, Population size Likely sample proportion.\n",
    "As data sets for this project have more than 200 entries, they met criertia.\n",

    "## Get the data.\n",
    "This project requires passive data collection, which means they are already exist. It uses data from the Simple Maps website contains a United States Cities database (the proper link has been included in the List of sourxes.). As it was mentioned above, the project requires to cross-reference of 2 provided data sets. The 2 files: uscities.csv and user_data.csv are attached to repository. \n",
